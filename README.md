# Ray tracing in onw week-end

This is my implementation of the ray tracing algorithm described in the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley. The code is written in Rust and is intended to be a learning exercise. Writen in Rust to learn the language.
